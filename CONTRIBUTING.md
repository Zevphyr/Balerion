I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition and I hope you all learn something new along the way. 

If you haven't already, come find us in Discord (https://discord.gg/du6tZtd). We want you working on things you're excited about. 


Please send a GitHub Pull Request to https://github.com/Zevphyr/Balerion/new/master with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). 
 Please retrict it to one feature per commit.
 
 Where possible and within reason, keep your code compatible for use across servers; it should ideally work an entirely new channel id and guild id with no loss of function.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit"
> 
> "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."



Thank you!

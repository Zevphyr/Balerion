# Balerion
Discord bot primarily used in the Discord guild: "CS Study Group".


Balerion is a bot made for administrative aid in small discord guilds, to provide educational resources for programming, and as an educational tool in and of itself. Creator is "Zevphyr" and the source for the bot can be found at: https://github.com/Zevphyr/Balerion/

To get started with contributing, please read all of the relevant text documents, and look at the content within the "Examples" folder.
When you feel ready, you can either create a fork a this bot and attempt to contribute; rebuild the bot from ground up to learn the process; or take the framework and alter it to suit your needs. All I ask is that you share it with the rest of the community as well. 

Please be sure to also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Zevphyr/Balerion/wiki) for help on how to get started with creating your bot.
